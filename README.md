# angularWithTypescript
Following the Pluralsight video "Play by Play Angular with Typescript".

- Installed typescript globally.
- Installed some typescript definitions with save. It created a tsd.json file with dependencies.
- Created src folder for typescript files and a tsconfig file that configures typescript.
- Added an extra tsd.d.ts file to point to the other one in the typings folder.
- Added a task in Code to build typescript directly from the editor (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript)
